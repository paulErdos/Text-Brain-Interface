* Word display time should be expanded for words above a certain length
* A button to go back a fixed number of words would be nice.
* Being able to save one's spot would be nice. 
* Larger text
* Rotate with rotation lock off. Keep the slider in its same orientation, now vertical, and always at the same end to allow users to use either thumb.
